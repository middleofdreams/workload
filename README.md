Workload
========
Workload is project to create simple, yet customizable task management application.

Currently there are plenty similar applications but Workload suppose to work according 3 main principles:
 - Always on hand - just one keyboard shortcut to bring small application window to front
 - Data is only in user hands - there are plans to add some synchronization but nothing will be send to cloud/online storages etc
 - Customizable appereance - there's always an option to tweak some colors, windows opacity etc
 
There is no release yet but current code is working pretty well.

System requirements:
 - python 3 (preferably) or python > 2.5
 - latest PySide
 - pywin (to handle global shortcuts on Windows)
 - python-xlib (to handle global shortcuts on Linux)
