This program was created to help 
with task organization and prioritizing them.
Current features:

  + create task from input box
when you use format number:taskname or taskname:number 
new task will be created with priority set in 'number'
(priorities are numbers from 0-5)

  + edit task name and description
(it's not checking if tasks have same name, 
will check in some time..)
	
  + set task end date 
(does just that.. )
	
  + drag and drop
(now it partially works, 
you can drop task title and description separately,
planned to do this automatically)
	
Planned features:

  + manage tasks in different contexts 
(work, home, shopping, etc..)
  + synchronize tasks with Android App
  + import/export tasks to file
  +...
